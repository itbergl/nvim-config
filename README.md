# Neovim Config

This is a repo for my Neovim configuration files. I use Lazy as a plugin manager.

I am planning on making a new branch for a more "barebones" config for quick use on new machines.

## Installation

To use my config, clone the repo into ``.config/nvim`` and launch neovim.

You may need to install ``lazygit``, ``ripgrep``, ``npm`` and ``fzf``.
